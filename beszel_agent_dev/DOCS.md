# Beszel Agent (Test) for Home Assistant

⚠️ **This is a DEVELOPMENT version** - Use for testing new features and changes only. For production use, install the stable "Beszel Agent" or "Beszel Agent (S.M.A.R.T.)" add-on instead.

Monitor your Home Assistant system with Beszel. This add-on runs the Beszel agent and reports stats to your Beszel Hub.

## What makes this Dev version different:

- **Automatic builds** on every code change
- **Multiple image tags**: version tag, `:latest-dev`, and commit SHA
- **Bleeding edge features** that may not be fully tested
- **May have bugs** - not recommended for critical systems

## What it monitors:

- CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Home Assistant Add-ons (via Docker API)
- Historical data with trends

Lightweight design that won't slow down your system.

## Installation and Setup

Follow the [Installation and Setup Guide](../docs/INSTALLATION.md) to install the add-on.
